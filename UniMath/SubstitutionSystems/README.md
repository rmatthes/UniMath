# Heterogeneous substitution systems

Formalization of heterogeneous substitution systems as defined in

Matthes & Uustalu, [Substitution in Non-wellfounded Syntax with Variable Binding](http://www.irit.fr/~Ralph.Matthes/papers/MatthesUustalu-final.pdf)


Report on the formalization and some additional results are given in

Ahrens & Matthes, [Heterogeneous substitution systems revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04299)
